#  Olympics Data Analysis Project

##  Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the historical Olympics dataset covering more than 120 years of Olympic history.
The goal is to understand trends in participation, medal distribution, countries performance, athlete achievements, and sports popularity.

This project is inspired by analysis workflows commonly taught in tutorials from CampusX.

##  Dataset

The dataset contains:

* **athlete_events.csv** → athlete information (age, height, sport, medal, etc.)
* **noc_regions.csv** → country / region mapping

Key features:

* Athlete demographics
* Olympic year and city
* Sport and event
* Medal information
* Country/region

---

##  Objectives

* Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
* Generate overall Olympics statistics
* Create medal tally by country
* Analyze participation trends over time
* Identify most successful athletes
* Perform country-wise analysis
* Analyze gender participation
* Visualize sport popularity

---

##  Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab

---

##  Analysis Included

* Overall statistics (editions, sports, events, athletes, countries)
* Medal tally analysis
* Nations / Events / Athletes trend over years
